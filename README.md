# mars-scraping-challenge

## Part 1
LA Sunshine assisted in how to get only the specific text wanted when the assignment requested "all"
I used mrpbennett answer to this stackoverflow question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71940341/how-to-save-scraped-data-to-json-in-python to help me output the scraped data

## Part 2
Tutor Alysia Won helped with the issue I had with getting the for loop to not pull 'none' 
I used Matplotlib and pandas documentation for reminders of syntax
